### Hangman

### A word is randomly generated from a wordbank.

Guess the letters in the word to complete the word. Caution: Everytime you input a wrong letter, the hangman will begin to form. If the hangman forms before the word is complete, you lose.

### The game consists of 3 words, you need to answer at least 2 words to win the game.

Features
Sounds, alerts, pictures of hangman, game reset.

### Pain Points

Managing MVP vs Stretch goal. Thinking about data in terms of structure and scalability.
Changing the image of hangman after each wrong answer.
Trying to use object modeling.

### Tech

HTML,CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, gihub.

### Approach

#### Wednesday

1. Secure all game images.

Images needed:
Will need several hangman images, these will be swapped out every time the user enters a letter
that is not part of the word.
Find background Image for game.

2. Plan html elements needed. Code skeleton of game.
3. Create word bank by entering words into an array.

#### Thursday

1. Pseudo code and start coding!
2. Grab the textContent of each letter pressed, check to see if the word contains that letter and enter in the correct empty slot.
3. Make a counter that keeps track of any instance of a "wrong letter choice".
4. Make an event listener for the same as above, when the event is triggered the hangman image will be swapped out to reflect another body part being added.

#### Friday

1.Build the winning and losing conditionals.
2.Make a game reset.
3.Progress check with Instructional team.

4. Debug any issues.

#### Saturday

1.If game is working, try to add additional features to make game more interesting or harder.
i.e. external word bank, categorizing words, other cool stuff.
2.Otherwise troubleshoot code.

#### Sunday

1. Make landing page, display and hide on "click".
2. Make it pretty. Focus on positioning and CSS.
3. Fix any last minute bugs.
